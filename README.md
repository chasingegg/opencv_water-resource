# opencv_water-resource

use opencv to capture faces and the amount of people impacts water level.



## We are going to appeal to everybody to conserve water resources.

the basic idea is that first we have a video that a fish swims freely, and when someone appears with face detected, the water level will drop down, finally the fish will die. When the person leaves, the water level will rise again. 

Below are some screenshots.
